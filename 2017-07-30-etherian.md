##### [Casper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/) (Dev Channel) – Proof of Stake Protocol
- A staker must withdraw his entire deposit if he chooses to leave the validator pool (4 month withdrawl timeframe). 
- Regarding how staking pools will function (from @darcius):
  >Rocket Pool uses a token that backs your current deposit, you can withdraw this anytime and trade it back to Rocket Pool for ether or sell it on the free market.

- Christian Lundkvist:
  >The "unable to verify JWT" happens when the app can't find your profile data on IPFS. Try updating your profile picture and wait a bit, this should refresh. If that doesn't work you may need to recreate your identity from scratch.
- Christian Lundkvist:
  >In general you can use uport-connect to request the user to disclose things. They way the disclosure is made is by signing a "response", so this also doubles as an authentication mechanism. We are in the process of making this more secure, should be done within a couple weeks or so (but you can still play around with it)
