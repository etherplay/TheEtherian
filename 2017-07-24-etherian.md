- [Casper Research 14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SStjwzVnXl0) (slow week b/c of the IC3 Workshop)
- Vitalik Buterin: 
  >The general impression I get at this point is that discouragement attacks on Casper are the main thing that people are worried about; I have heard no complaints about the rest of the incentive structure but we do need a better answer for "well won't an attacker just grief a bit to kick everyone else out of the validator pool, and then do attacks?"

- Advice from Luke Hedger for if you're having trouble with Rinkby:
  >Since v 231 of the alpha, accounts are created on Rinkeby by default. But you can still create an identity on Ropsten from Settings>Advanced Options>Add Identity on Ropsten then switch to the account that appears under Settings>Other Identities.
Had to get some Ether from http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/ sent to device address (Settings>Developer Tools>Device>Address) to register with AppManager - you should see the Device Gas go up.
